# Welcome to My GitHub Portfolio

Hello and welcome to my GitHub portfolio! Here, you'll find a collection of my data analyst projects, showcasing my skills and experience in the field. While my focus is currently on data analysis, I'm actively working towards expanding into the realm of data science in the near future. I am passionate about the insights data provide and constantly strive to expand my skills.

## Project Categories

### 1. Helpful Modules

In the `helpful_modules` folder, you will find modules that I have written to streamline common tasks encountered during data analysis projects. These modules are designed to simplify processes such as extracting data saved in my Google Cloud account, enabling more efficient workflows. These modules are built with the goal of promoting code reuse and productivity.

### 2. Linguistic Projects

The `linguistic_projects` folder contains projects focused on linguistic analysis, aimed to help me complete my Masters in Linguistics at San Jose State University. Currently, you will find one project in this category, which involves setting up surveys to elicit syntactic variation in English as well as analyzing the output of the data. These projects demonstrate my interest in linguistics and how it intersects with data analysis. These projects highlight my interest in exploring language patterns and applying data analysis techniques to gain insights into linguistic phenomena. I aim to further expand this category with more exciting linguistic projects in the future.

### 3. DataCamp Projects

In the `datacamp_projects` folder, you will find a diverse array of projects that I have completed while working on my DataCamp certifications. These projects cover a wide range of topics and methodologies, providing a comprehensive overview of my data analysis skills. Some of these projects are guided, allowing me to follow specific instructions and learn new concepts, while others are unguided, allowing me to showcase my ability to work independently and apply my knowledge to real-world datasets. I am eager to continue expanding my skill set through future DataCamp endeavors.

## Future Direction

While my current portfolio mainly focuses on data analysis, I am actively working towards expanding into the field of data science. I plan to incorporate more advanced machine learning projects, predictive modeling, and data-driven solutions into my portfolio. By continuously updating and expanding my projects, I aim to demonstrate my growth and expertise in the evolving field of data science.
